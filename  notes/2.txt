2.1 Polynomial Definition
    f(x) = a0 +a1*x+a2*x^2+an*x^n
    the coefficients ai are real numbers
    the degree of the polynomial is the integer n

    f(x) = 0
    zero polynomial by convention has the degree -1

    todo: Horner's method
    todo: Backus-Naur form

2.2 Notation
    domain - all possible inputs
    range - all possible outputs
    codomain - type of possible outputs

2.3 Existence and Uniqueness
    todo: Kleinberg's Impossibility Theorem for Clustering

    For any integer n >= 0  and any list of n+1 points that are pairs of real numbers (xi,yi) with x0 < x1 < xn
    there is a unique degree n polynomial passing through a choice of n+1 points
